Here you'll find some random little things i've worked on or am currently working on. 

There's everything from Node.js web apps, to little bash or python scripts, to full on Minecraft mods! :D

I'm a part time:
- Sysadmin 
- Programmer
- Software Translator

I'm also currently a full time student, studying at [RTU](https://rtu.lv) in Riga, Latvia.

If you want to contact me for whatever reason, head over [here](https://mednis.id.lv)... I don't bite!
